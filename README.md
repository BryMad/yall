# YALL\*E

## A LoneStar Codin' Experience

Experts have prophesied that American regional accents will one day be extinct. YALL\*E is a coding language for anyone who (like me) grew up hearing the soothing sounds of a Texas drawl and will miss it when it's gone, and/or anyone who wants to bring a little wild west, rootin-tootin' LoneStar spirit to their hoity-toity, city-fied code.

(editors note to Dr. Toal: I wish I had a bit more inspiration to do a language that served a function vs just tweaking commands to a dialect, but currently haven't had that bolt of inspiration (plus feeling a bit out of my depth in this class), so rolling with this for now. Stretch goal is to add something else that makes it fun or answers a coding need, but still hunting for that)
